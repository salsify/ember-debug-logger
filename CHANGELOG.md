## Unreleased

Upgrade to ember-auto-import 2.x

## v2.1.1 - 04/09/2019

This release fixes a bug introduced in `v2.1.0` â€” `debug@4` contains ES6 syntax that breaks compatibility with IE11. We now lock our `debug` dependency below version 4.

## v2.1.0 - 04/09/2019

This release moved to pulling `debug` directly from npm and bringing it into the host application via `ember-auto-import` rather than the AMD build of `debug-dist`.

## v2.0.0 - 10/02/2018

This release removes the automatic injection of the `debug` method on many container-owned objects. To migrate forward, you can either set `debug: debugLogger()` on those objects explicitly or reinstate the implicit injection in your own instance initializer:

```js
export function initialize(instance) {
  instance.register('debug-logger:main', debugLogger(), { instantiate: false });

  // Do this for each type you want the injection on
  instance.inject('route', 'debug', 'debug-logger:main');
}

export default {
  name: 'debug-logger',
  initialize,
};
```
